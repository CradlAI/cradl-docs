## Who Cradl AI is (and isn't) for

1. Cradl AI is designed for businesses of all sizes - from solo entrepreneurs and freelancers to small businesses and teams within large, public companies. While most of our customers work at companies with 1 to 500 employees, we also support Fortune 500 enterprises with complex procurement processes and strict compliance requirements.
2. Cradl AI is built for users of all technical backgrounds. Our mission is to provide the most intuitive and user-friendly document automation platform for **citizen developers** — so you don’t need to know anything about JSON, APIs, or LLMs to get value from Cradl AI.

   If you’re more technically inclined, you’ll find plenty of flexibility too. We support custom code, webhooks, HTTP requests, and more - giving you the control you need without unnecessary complexity.

   However, if you’re looking for an open-source tool to self-host and manage entirely through code, Cradl AI probably isn’t the best fit.
