## [******Who Relay.app is (and isn't) for******](http://Relay.app)

1. [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is designed to be used **at work**. While many users find [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) valuable in their personal lives and schoolwork, our focus is to help people get work done at their jobs. This is why our pricing, integrations, and features are optimized for people at work.
2. [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is built for **businesses of all shapes and sizes**. Our customers include solopreneurs, freelancers, small businesses, and teams within large, public companies. Most of our customers work at business with between 1 and 500 employees. If you work at a company with a complex enterprise procurement process and strict regulatory compliance guidelines, [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is probably not the best choice for you.
3. [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is built for users of **all technical abilities**. In particular, our goal is to build the easiest to use and most intuitive product for less technical users. So if you don't know anything about JSON, APIs, or LLMs, [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is for you\! If you are comfortable with more advanced technical constructs, we do support custom code, webhooks, HTTP requests, and anything else you'd need. If you are looking for an open source tool that you can self host and interact with primarily via code, [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) is probably not the best choice for you.
