### Why use formatters?

When extracting values like dates, numbers, or currency amounts, consistency is key. Formatters allow you to clean up and standardize this data automatically — ensuring it’s ready for downstream systems.

Typical use cases include:

- **Normalizing dates**  
  Convert various date formats into a standardized format such as ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`), regardless of how the date appears in the source document.

- **Cleaning up numbers**  
  Remove spaces, local separators, or other inconsistencies to ensure all numbers follow a consistent format, like `1,000.00`.

- **Formatting currencies**  
  Strip unnecessary symbols or convert values into your preferred currency format to make them easier to store and compare.

Formatters run after extraction, so your model can focus on identifying the correct values — and the formatter ensures those values are clean, consistent, and ready to use.
