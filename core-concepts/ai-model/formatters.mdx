Formatters help you clean up and standardize extracted values — so your data is consistent, structured, and ready for use in downstream systems. They run after extraction, allowing your model to focus on finding the right values while the formatter ensures they’re in the right shape.

### Available Formatters

Here’s a quick overview of the formatters you can use to normalize your extracted data:

- **Numeric**\
  Cleans up numbers by removing spaces and separators, ensuring a consistent numeric format (e.g. `1000.00`).
- **Date**\
  Converts dates into a standard format, such as ISO 8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`), regardless of how the date is written in your document.
- **RegEx**\
  Extracts a specific part of a field using regular expressions. Useful when the raw value contains more than you need. For example, you can use a RegEx formatter to remove the prefix INV- from all invoice numbers, so INV-1023 becomes 1023.
- **Classification**\
  Maps  values to pre-defined categories or classes. Useful for tasks like determining the document type (e.g. Invoice, Receipt, Contract) or checking whether a document has been signed (e.g. Signed or Not Signed).
