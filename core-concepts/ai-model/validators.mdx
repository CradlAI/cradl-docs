Validators let you define rules that check whether extracted fields meet your requirements — so you only review documents that actually need attention. This helps you reduce manual work and improve data quality at scale.

### Available Validators

Here’s a quick overview of the validators you can use to automatically flag documents for review:

- **Confidence threshold**\
  Triggers a review if the model’s confidence in a field is below a specified percentage. Useful for catching uncertain predictions.
- **Logical expression**\
  Validates a field using custom logic (e.g. `total_amount > 0`). Ideal for numeric checks, date comparisons, and other business rules.
- **RegEx**\
  Ensures that a field matches a specific pattern using regular expressions. Great for validating formats like postal codes, VAT numbers, or phone numbers.
- **Cannot be empty**\
  Flags the document if a required field is missing or empty. Use this to make sure essential information is always extracted.
