Cradl AI uses Large Language Models (LLMs) that are trained to understand text much like a human would. This means your agents can handle a wide variety of documents, even if layouts, wording, or formats change from one file to another.

Here you can:

- [**Add a prompt→**](/core-concepts/ai-model/prompting)\
  Write clear instructions that tell your agent what to extract.
- [**Add validators →**](/core-concepts/ai-model/validators)\
  Add field-level checks to make sure extracted data is accurate.
- [**Add formatters→**](/core-concepts/ai-model/formatters)\
  Format outputs so your data is always structured the way you need it.
- **Improve your model**\
  Refine prompts, validation rules, and feedback loops to continuously improve your results.
