## How workflows work

A Workflow in Cradl AI is made up of **nodes**. Each node represents an action your documents go through — like model predictions, validation checks, or human review.

Here’s a typical Workflow:

1. **Document upload**\
   Upload documents via the API, dashboard, or integrations.
2. **Prediction**\
   Run your trained extraction model to process the document.
3. **Validation**\
   Apply field-level validators or confidence thresholds.
4. **Manual review**\
   If validation fails, send the document to a human reviewer using Cradl AI’s built-in review UI.
5. **Export**\
   Once validated, send the structured data to your target system via webhooks or direct integrations.
