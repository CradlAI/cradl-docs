## Key building terms to know

**Workflow: **These are automations built in Parabola; they look like a flowchart in your favorite dot-ruled notebook.

**Nodes: **Flows are made up of steps and arrows. Every step either pulls in data into Parabola, pushes data out of Parabola, or transforms data within Parabola. Think of these as your data choreography or sheet music. In the screenshot below, you'll see two steps. One is an integration pulling in data from Google Drive and the other is a transform that cleans the data in a specific way.
