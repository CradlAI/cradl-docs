### What you can do in Runs

The Runs section makes it easy to:

- **See all processed documents**\
  Get a complete overview of every document that has run through your workflows — including when it was uploaded, which model was used, and the current status.
- **Check status at a glance**\
  Instantly see whether a document was processed successfully, if it needs manual review, or if something failed.
- **Upload new documents**\
  Drag and drop files directly or use the upload button to add new documents for processing.
- **Open flagged documents**\
  If a document didn’t meet your confidence threshold or failed validation, it will appear here as **Waiting for review**.
- **Start the review process**\
  Click any flagged document to open it in the dedicated review UI. Here, you can correct or confirm extracted fields to improve accuracy and retrain your model.
