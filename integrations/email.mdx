## Introduction
Use Mailhooks to send documents to your Cradl AI agent by email. Each agent gets a unique email address; any supported attachments sent to that address are processed automatically.

## Before you begin
- Have a Cradl AI agent ready to receive documents.
- Prepare a test document to email as an attachment.
- (Optional) Decide whether to restrict allowed senders for the trigger.

## Set up your Mailhook
Follow these steps to create the email trigger and test it with a sample document.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add an Email trigger">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new trigger. Choose **Email** from the list of integrations. Copy the generated email address (for example, `12345678910@agent.cradl.ai`).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restrict allowed senders (optional)">
    In the trigger settings, you can limit which email addresses are allowed to send documents. This helps prevent unwanted submissions.
    
    <Tip>Re-create the mailhook trigger or adjust the allowed senders list if the address is shared more broadly than intended.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send a test email">
    Email the mailhook address with one or more supported attachments. Example:

```
To: 12345678910@agent.cradl.ai
Subject: Invoice for July
Attachments: invoice-july.pdf
```

    Supported attachments: PDFs, PNGs, JPEGs, WEBPs, and TIFFs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify processing">
    Return to your agent and confirm the document run completed successfully. When processing finishes, the extracted data is available to any configured exports.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your agent now receives documents sent to the mailhook address and processes them automatically.

## Troubleshooting

- No attachments: emails without attachments are ignored.
- Unsupported files: ensure attachments are a supported type and not password-protected.
- Not receiving documents: double-check the mailhook address and any allowed-sender restrictions.
- Forwarded messages: make sure your email client keeps attachments when forwarding (Gmail/Outlook work fine).
