Cradl AI now supports triggering document parsing workflows directly from incoming emails using **Mailhooks**. This integration allows you to automate document ingestion by simply sending or forwarding emails to a unique email address.

### How It Works

1. You get a unique email address tied to your Cradl AI Agent.
2. You send or forward emails with attachments to this address.
3. Cradl AI receives the email, extracts the attachment(s), and runs them through the specified Agent.

### Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Mailhook Trigger

1. Navigate to the **Workflows** tab in your parser.
2. Click **Add Trigger** â†’ Choose **Email**.
3. Copy your generated email address (e.g., `12345678910@agent.cradl.ai`).

### 2. Send Documents via Email

Send an email to the mailhook address with one or more supported attachments.

**Example:**

```
To: 12345678910@agent.cradl.ai
Subject: Invoice for July
Attachments: invoice-july.pdf
```

Attachments will be processed automatically.
