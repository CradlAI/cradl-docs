Webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Cradl AI, such as when a document has been processed by an AI Agent. When an event occurs, Cradl AI will send an HTTP `POST` request to your webhook endpoint configured for the event type. The payload carries a JSON object. You can then use the information from the request's JSON payload to send the data where you need it.

### Payload structure

The payload of a webhook is a JSON object that contains the following properties:

- `documentId`: Unique ID of the processed document
- `documentUrl`: Link to view the document in Cradl AI
- `modelId`: ID of the model used for extraction
- `modelName`: Name of the extraction model
- `createdAt`: Time the document was processed
- `fields`: Extracted fields from the document
- `rawText`: Full raw text (optional, based on your export settings)

Below is an example of the payload Cradl AI sends to your webhook URL:

### **Securing Webhooks**

- Always use HTTPS endpoints.
- Validate the **Signing Secret** on incoming requests to confirm they came from Cradl AI.
- Respond quickly — your endpoint should acknowledge receipt with a `2XX` status code within a few seconds.
