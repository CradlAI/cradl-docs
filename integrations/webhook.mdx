Webhooks allow you to receive event notifications from Cradl AI, such as when a document has been processed by an AI Agent. When an event occurs, Cradl AI will send an HTTP `POST` request to your webhook endpoint configured for the event type. The payload carries a JSON object. You can then use the information from the request's JSON payload to send the data where you need it.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive data as JSON">
    When a document is processed, Cradl AI sends a structured **JSON payload** to your endpoint.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payload structure

The payload of a webhook is a JSON object that contains the following properties:

- `documentId`: Unique ID of the processed document
- `documentUrl`: Link to view the document in Cradl AI
- `modelId`: ID of the model used for extraction
- `modelName`: Name of the extraction model
- `createdAt`: Time the document was processed
- `fields`: Extracted fields from the document
- `rawText`: Full raw text (optional, based on your export settings)

Below is an example of the payload Cradl AI sends to your webhook URL:

```json
{
  "documentId": "doc_123456789",
  "documentUrl": "https://app.cradl.ai/docs/doc_123456789",
  "modelId": "model_abc123",
  "modelName": "Invoice Parser",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-01T12:00:00Z",
  "fields": {
    "invoice_number": "INV-1001",
    "date": "2025-07-30",
    "total_amount": "1599.00",
    "currency": "USD",
    "vendor_name": "Example Corp"
  },
  "rawText": "Optional full text of the document..."
}
```

### **Securing Webhooks**

- Always use HTTPS endpoints.
- Validate the **Signing Secret** on incoming requests to confirm they came from Cradl AI.
- Respond quickly — your endpoint should acknowledge receipt with a `2XX` status code within a few seconds.
