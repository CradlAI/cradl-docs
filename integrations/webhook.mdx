**Use webhooks to get real-time notifications when key events happen in your Cradl AI workspace.**

Webhooks allow you to receive automatic notifications when your Cradl AI agenst process documents, predictions complete, or other events occur. With webhooks, you can build custom integrations such as:

- Automatically syncing extracted data to your database.
- Triggering a Zapier workflow when a new document is processed.
- Sending prediction results to a data pipeline (e.g. Segment) in real-time.
- Notifying your team in Slack when a new document is uploaded and processed.
- Powering custom automation flows, such as creating invoices in your ERP system when new data is extracted.

**Note:** Events triggered by bulk operations (e.g. bulk upload or bulk delete) may not always trigger individual webhook events.

## Creating a Webhook

To create a webhook for your Cradl AI workspace, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Webhooks settings**

   Navigate to the **Webhooks** section in your [Cradl AI Dashboard](https://app.cradl.ai/).
2. **Click “Create Webhook”**

   Select **Create Webhook** to start setting up a new webhook.
3. **Fill in the webhook form**
   - **Name:** Give your webhook a clear, descriptive name.
   - **URL:** Enter the HTTPS URL for your server endpoint where Cradl AI should send the webhook payload. _(Tip: Use _[_webhook.site_](http://webhook.site)_ for quick testing.)_
   - **Signing Secret:** A unique secret is auto-generated for you. Use this to verify the authenticity of incoming webhook requests.
   - **Events:** Select one or more events you’d like to listen to. See [Available Events](https://chatgpt.com/c/68761beb-55b0-800c-8dae-f0b8dd0a2c3d#available-events).
4. **Click “Create Webhook”**

   Save your webhook to start receiving real-time notifications.

## Available Events

## Viewing Webhook Logs

You can monitor webhook deliveries right in your dashboard:

1. Go to **Webhooks settings**.
2. Select the webhook you’d like to inspect.
3. Click on the **Logs** tab.

Here, you’ll see all webhook events sent to your endpoint, their delivery status, and detailed payloads for debugging.

---

## Sending Test Events

Want to verify that your integration works before going live? You can send test events:

1. Open your **Webhook Details** page.
2. Click the **⋮** icon in the top-right corner and select **Send Test Event**.
3. Pick an event type and click **Send Test Webhook**.

You’ll see a confirmation, and the test event will be sent to your webhook URL immediately.

## Retry Behavior

If your webhook endpoint doesn’t respond with a successful `2XX` status code, Cradl AI will automatically retry delivery to ensure you don’t miss critical events.

**Retry schedule:**

| Attempt        | Delay          |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| 1st            | 10 seconds     |
| 2nd            | 2 minutes      |
| 3rd            | 30 minutes     |
| 4th            | 6 hours        |
| 5th and onward | Every 24 hours |

Retries use an exponential backoff and will continue up to 24 hours after the 5th attempt.

---

## Automatic Disablement

To maintain system stability, Cradl AI will automatically disable a webhook if your endpoint fails repeatedly:

- Notifications will be sent to workspace admins after 5, 10, and 15 consecutive failed attempts.
- After 20 failed attempts, the webhook will be disabled automatically.
- You can re-enable it anytime by visiting the **Webhook Details** page and clicking **Enable Webhook**.

---

## Securing Webhooks

- Always use HTTPS endpoints.
- Validate the **Signing Secret** on incoming requests to confirm they came from Cradl AI.
- Respond quickly — your endpoint should acknowledge receipt with a `2XX` status code within a few seconds.
