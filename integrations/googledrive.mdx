<Info>
  This integration is coming soon.
</Info>

The **Google Drive integration** in Cradl AI allows you to connect your Google Drive account to automate document processing workflows. You can use Google Drive both as a **trigger** (to import files for processing) and as an **export destination** (to save processed outputs).

### Use Cases

- **Automatically process new files** uploaded to a specific Google Drive folder.
- **Save extracted data, parsed files, or processed documents** directly back to Google Drive.
- Combine Google Drive with other integrations (e.g., email, Slack, webhooks) for end-to-end automation.

### Use Google Drive as an Export

**When to use:**\
Send your processed files, extracted data, or custom outputs back to Google Drive.

**How to set up:**

1. In your workflow’s **Export** step, select **Google Drive** as the export destination.
2. Choose the target folder where you’d like to save the output.
3. Define the output file format (e.g., JSON, PDF, CSV) and file naming convention.
4. Optional: Set up folder structures dynamically using extracted fields (e.g., save invoices by date or client name).

## Security & Permissions

When you connect your Google Drive account, Cradl AI uses secure OAuth 2.0 authentication. You can revoke access anytime from your Google account settings. Cradl AI only requests the minimum permissions needed to read from and write to the specified folders.

## Example Workflow

> **Example:** Automatically extract invoice data and save a structured JSON file back to Drive.
>
> 1. **Trigger:** New PDF uploaded to `/Invoices/Incoming` folder.
> 2. **Process:** Cradl AI extracts the invoice data using your trained model.
> 3. **Export:** Structured JSON and a copy of the original file are saved to `/Invoices/Processed`.
