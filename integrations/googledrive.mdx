## Introduction
Automatically send new files added to a Google Drive folder to your Cradl AI agent using Zapier. This guide walks you through creating a Zap with Google Drive as the trigger and Cradl AI as the action that extracts data from each file.

## Before you begin
- A [Zapier](https://www.zapier.com) account
- A Google Drive folder with a sample file to test
- A Cradl AI agent to process documents

## Connecting your Cradl AI agent with Google Drive
Follow the steps below to create a Zap that watches a Drive folder and processes new files in Cradl AI.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Cradl AI Zapier credentials">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new trigger. Choose **Zapier** from the list of integrations. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the integration panel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Zap with Google Drive as the trigger">
    In Zapier, click **Create Zap**. For the **Trigger**, select **Google Drive** and choose an event:
    - **New File in Folder**. Fires when a file is added to a specific folder. *(Recommended)*
    - **New File**. Fires when a file is added anywhere you specify. *(Alternative)*

    Connect your Google account, then specify **Drive** and **Folder**. Test the trigger and make sure Zapier finds a sample file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Cradl AI action">
    Add an action step and select **Cradl AI**. For **Action Event**, choose **Extract Data From Document**.

    <Row>

      <Image src="/images/zapier-setup-step.png" alt="Choose Extract Data From Document action in Zapier" />
    </Row>

    Under **Account**, click **Connect a new account** and paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Step 1. Click **Continue**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the action inputs">
    Configure the Cradl AI action by specifying **Agent**, **Document** and **Filename** *(optional)*.

    <Tip>To limit to specific file types, add a Zapier **Filter** step between the trigger and action to allow only PDF, PNG, or JPG (or whichever formats your agent supports).</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and publish">
    Run a test for the Cradl AI action. Confirm that the action succeeds and that you can see extracted fields in the output. Then **Publish** your Zap to start processing new files dropped into the selected Google Drive folder.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your Zap now sends new Google Drive files to your Cradl AI agent automatically.

## Tips
- Use a dedicated “inbox” folder in Drive for documents you want processed, and move or archive files after processing to avoid re‑triggers.
- If the Drive trigger doesn’t include the expected file object, switch to the **New File in Folder** event and ensure the file is added after the Zap is turned on.
- For larger files, allow extra time for Google Drive and Zapier to make the file available to downstream steps.

## Troubleshooting
- Cradl AI action fails: Reconnect the **Cradl AI** account in Zapier using fresh credentials from the Cradl AI integration panel, then re‑test the step.
- No file in the action: In the Cradl AI step, ensure **Document** is mapped to the Google Drive `File` output (not a URL or name field).
- Zap doesn’t trigger: Verify the watched folder is correct and that the file was added after the Zap was turned on. For Shared Drives, enable Team Drives in the trigger setup.
