## Introduction
This guide walks you through exporting data from a Cradl AI agent to Zapier. From there, you can route the extracted data to thousands of apps supported by Zapier.

## Before you begin
- Ensure that you have an active [Zapier](https://www.zapier.com) account
- Prepare a test document to upload when you run the flow.

## Setting up your Zap
The steps below enable the export in Cradl AI, create a Zap with Cradl AI as the trigger, connect your account, and complete the configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Zapier export">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new export. Select **Zapier** from the list of integrations, then copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Zapier integration panel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your Cradl AI account in Zapier">
    Click **Connect**. This opens Zapier and pre-configures a new Zap with Cradl AI as the trigger. Click **Select an account**,
    then paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you copied in Step 1. Click **Continue**, choose the Cradl AI
    **Agent** and **Action** you want to receive results from, then click **Continue**.

    </Row>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Cradl AI trigger">
    If you haven't done so already, upload and validate a document in your Cradl AI agent to ensure data is available. In Zapier, click **Test your trigger**. Zapier will fetch recent document runs from your Cradl AI account. Select one and continue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an action step">
    Choose the destination app you want to export data to. In this example, we'll use *Google Sheets*. Map the extracted fields, such as `Total Amount` and `Supplier Name`, to the target fields.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish the Zap">
    When you're ready, click **Publish** to activate your Zap. Back in Cradl AI, refresh the page; you should see that the Zapier export is configured successfully.
    
    <Warning>Your Zap must be published for documents to be processed by your Zap, even during testing and experimentation.</Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>


Your Zap now receives extracted data from your Cradl AI agent whenever the export action runs.

## Troubleshooting

- **No data appearing in Zapier.** Ensure your Cradl AI agent has finished processing the document before the Zap’s trigger runs.
- **Missing fields.** Retest the Cradl AI trigger in Zapier with a fresh document to refresh available fields.
- **Connection issues.** Reconnect your Cradl AI account in Zapier using the current **Client ID/Client Secret** from the **Workflow → Import from Zapier** panel.
