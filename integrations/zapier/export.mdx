#### Introduction
In this guide, we’ll go through the steps required to export data from a Cradl AI agent to Zapier. From here, you can, for example, route the extracted data into thousands of apps supported by Zapier.

#### Before you begin

- An active **Zapier** account.
- Your **Cradl AI** client credentials ready (from the Integrations page).
- A sample document to test the export.

#### Setting up your Zap
In the following steps, we’ll enable the export in Cradl AI, create a Zap with Cradl AI as the trigger, connect your account, and finish configuration.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Zapier export">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new export. Choose **Zapier** from the list of integrations. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Zapier integration panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect your Cradl AI account in Zapier">
    Click **Connect**. This opens Zapier and pre-configures a new Zap with Cradl AI as the trigger. Click **Select an account**.
    and paste in the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you copied from Step 1. Then click **Continue**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Cradl AI trigger">
    If you haven't done so already, upload and validate a document in your Cradl AI agent to ensure there is data available. From Zapier, click **Test your trigger**. Zapier will fetch recent document runs from your Cradl AI account. Select one and continue.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an action step">
    Choose a destination app (for example, **Google Sheets** or **Slack**) and map extracted fields such as `Invoice Number`, `Date`, and `Total Amount` to the target fields.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish the Zap">
    Run a test to verify the mapped fields appear correctly, then click **Publish** to activate your Zap. If you navigate back to Cradl AI and refresh the page, you should see that the Zapier export is successfully configured.
  </Step>
</Steps>


Your Zap now receives extracted data from your Cradl AI agent whenever the export action runs.

## Troubleshooting

- **No data appearing in Zapier?** Ensure your Cradl AI agent has finished processing the document before the Zap’s trigger runs.
- **Fields missing?** Re-test the Cradl AI trigger in Zapier with a fresh document to refresh available fields.
- **Connection issues?** Reconnect the Cradl AI account in Zapier using current **Client ID/Secret** from **Settings → Integrations**.
