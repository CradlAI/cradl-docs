#### Introduction
In this guide, we’ll walk through sending a document from Zapier to your Cradl AI agent for extraction. From there, you can pass the results to other actions in your Zap.

#### Before you begin

- A Zapier account with permission to create and publish Zaps.
- Access to your Cradl AI workspace (to obtain client credentials).
- A sample document to use while testing.

#### Setting up your Zap
In the following steps, we’ll create a Zap, add the Cradl AI action, and map the document content to process.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Zapier trigger">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new trigger. Choose **Zapier** from the list of integrations. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the Zapier integration panel.
    
    <Image
      src="/images/zapier-config-panel.png"
      alt="Copy Client ID and Client Secret from the Cradl AI integration panel"
      />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Extract Data From Document action to your Zap">
    Add a new action step in your Zap and select **Cradl AI** as the app. For **Action Event**, choose **Extract Data From Document**.

    <Row>
      <Image src="/images/zapier-select-cradl.png" alt="Add a new action step in Zapier" size="small" />
      <Image src="/images/zapier-setup-step.png" alt="Add a new action step in Zapier" size="small" />
    </Row>

    Under **Account**, click **Connect a new account** and paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you copied in Step 1, then click **Continue**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the action">
    Choose the Cradl AI **Agent** that should process the file. For **Document** (or **File**), select the file from your trigger step. Optionally set **Filename** to pass the original file name to your agent.

    <Tip>**Pro tip**: If you need to pass additional values to your agent, add them as *Variables*. They will be visible to other actions in your agent.</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and publish">
    Run a test for the action and confirm a successful response and parsed output. Then **Publish** your Zap.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your Zap now sends documents from Zapier to your Cradl AI agent.

## Troubleshooting

- If Zapier reports `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden`, reconnect the **Cradl AI** account in Zapier using fresh credentials.
- If no output appears, make sure the file type is supported and not encrypted. Try again with a small sample document.
- If downstream steps can’t see fields, re-test the Cradl AI action in Zapier to refresh available output fields.
