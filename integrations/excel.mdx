## Overview

The Microsoft Excel integration allows you to write data to Excel spreadsehees from your Cradl AI workflow. It can append new rows, add a single row, or write to specific columns in your spreadsheet.

### Basic node operation

The Excel Writer integration works by mapping your workflow’s outputs to spreadsheet columns:

**Note**: The integration only works with a proffesional account.

1. **Sheet Connection**: Connect to an existing Google Sheet
2. **Column Detection**: The node reads the headers in the first row of your selected sheet
3. **Dynamic Inputs**: These headers become available as inputs to the node
4. **Data Mapping**: Connect outputs from previous nodes to these column inputs
5. **Execution**: When the flow runs, data is written to the corresponding columns

### Edit and preview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clone your docs locally" icon="github">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.

  <Accordion title="Preview changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the
       [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
       documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
       `docs.json` is): `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If you’re currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
