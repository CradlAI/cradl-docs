### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An **active Zapier account**.
- A **Cradl AI account** with an **Agent** configured to export to Zapier.
- At least one **document ready for export** to test your integration.

### Step 1: Connect to Zapier

1. In the Workflow section in Cradl AI, open the **Export to Zapier** action panel.
2. Click **Connect**. This opens Zapier and pre-configures a new Zap with Cradl AI as the trigger.
3. In the **Select an account** field, connect your Cradl AI account.
   - Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (available in the Cradl AI **Integration panel**).
4. Zapier will auto-fill the **Agent** and **Action** values in the configuration step.
5. Go to the **Test** tab and click **Test your trigger**.
   1.  Zapier will fetch recent document runs from your Cradl account.
   2. Select one and click **Continue with selected record**.
6. You will now be prompted to set up the next step in your Zap.

### Step 2: Add a new step in Zapier

Now that Zapier has access to your parsed data, you can map fields into another app.

For example, to export invoices into Google Sheets:

- **App:** Google Sheets
- **Action:** Create Spreadsheet Row (or Create Multiple Spreadsheet Rows)
- **Mapping:** Map fields like `Invoice Number`, `Date`, and `Total Amount` into pre-existing columns.

### Step 3: Test and publish your Zap

1. Run a test from Step 2 and confirm that parsed data appears correctly in your chosen destination app.
2. Click **Publish Zap**.

From now on, every time Cradl AI processes a document, Zapier will automatically send the structured data to your connected app.

### Example workflow

- You upload a **PDF invoice** to Cradl AI.
- Cradl extracts the `Invoice Number`, `Vendor`, `Total Amount`, and `Due Date`.
- Zapier receives the parsed data.
- The Zap automatically adds a new row to **Google Sheets** with those fields, and posts a message in **Slack** notifying your team.

### Troubleshooting

- **No data appearing in Zapier?** Ensure your Cradl AI Agent has finished processing the document before the trigger runs.
- **Fields missing?** Re-test the trigger in Zapier with a fresh document to refresh available fields.
