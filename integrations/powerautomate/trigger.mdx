#### Introduction
In this guide, we’ll go through the steps required to send a document from Power Automate to your Cradl AI agent for extraction.

#### Before you begin

- Confirm you can open the **Cradl AI** integration panel and have created the integration that provides client credentials.
- Verify the **Cradl AI for Power Automate** connector is available in your tenant (through a premium license or custom connector deployment).
- Prepare a test document to upload when you run the flow.

#### Setting up your Power Automate flow
In the following steps we’ll configure the flow in Power Automate by adding the Cradl AI action and specifying the document content to process.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Power Automate trigger">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new trigger. Choose **Power Automate** from the list of integrations. Click the **Import from Power Automate** trigger and copy the **Client Credentials** value from the configuration panel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Extract Data From Document action">
    In your Power Automate flow, add the **Extract Data From Document** action.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a connection to Cradl AI">
    In the **Client Credentials** field, paste the value you copied in Step 1.

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the action">
    Click the **Extract Data From Document** action to open its settings. Choose the Cradl AI **Agent** that should process the file. For **Document**, select the binary file content from an earlier step—for example, the `File Content` output from **Get file content (OneDrive)** or the file supplied by a manual trigger. Optionally set **Filename** so the agent receives the original name and extension.

    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your flow now sends documents from Power Automate to your Cradl AI agent.

## Troubleshooting

- Run the flow manually with your sample document and review the **Run history** entry. Expand the **Extract Data From Document** action and confirm its status code is `200`.
- If Power Automate reports `401 Unauthorized` or `404 Forbidden`, reopen the Cradl AI integration, copy fresh client credentials, and update the connection.
- For other errors, make sure the file format is supported, the document is not encrypted, and your Cradl AI usage limits have not been exceeded. The message under **Outputs → Body** provides details when validation fails.
