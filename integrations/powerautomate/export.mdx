#### Introduction
In this guide, we’ll go through the steps required to export data from a Cradl AI agent to a Power Automate flow. From here, you can, for example, route the extracted data to any destination supported by Power Automate.

#### Before you begin
- Verify the **Cradl AI for Power Automate** connector is available in your tenant (through a premium license or custom connector deployment).
- Have your **Cradl AI** client credentials ready (from the Integrations page).
- Prepare a test document you can process to trigger an export.

#### Setting up your Power Automate flow
In the following steps, we’ll enable export in Cradl AI, add the trigger in Power Automate, and create the connection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a Power Automate export">
    In Cradl AI, open your agent and add a new export. Choose **Power Automate** from the list of integrations. Click the _Export to Power Automate_ action to set up the export.
    Copy the **Client Credentials** value from the configuration panel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Extracted Data From Document trigger">
    In Power Automate, click **New flow** and select **Automated cloud flow**. In the trigger search box, type "Cradl" and select the **Extracted Data From Document** trigger from the Cradl AI connector.

    />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a connection from Power Automate to Cradl AI">
    If prompted, create a new Cradl AI connection by pasting the _Client Credentials_ you copied in Step 1. If you already have an existing connection, you can reuse it.

      style={{ width:"75%" }}
    />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select your agent">
    Ensure that the *Extracted Data From Document* trigger is open. In the *Export Action* field, select the Cradl AI agent you configured in Step 1.

      alt="Configure the Extracted Data From Document trigger in Power Automate"
      style={{ width:"75%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your Power Automate flow">
    This automatically configures your Cradl AI agent to send data to this Power Automate flow when the export action runs. In Cradl AI, open your agent and refresh the page. You should now see that the URL parameter is configured on your Power Automate export.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your flow now receives extracted data from your Cradl AI agent.

## Troubleshooting
- Process a test document in Cradl AI to trigger the export. In Power Automate, open the flow’s **Run history** and confirm the **Extracted Data From Document** trigger succeeded.
- In Cradl AI, open your agent and select the **Export to Power Automate** action. Make sure the URL field has a value. This is automatically set when configuring the Cradl AI trigger from Power Automate.
- In Cradl AI, go to **Export to Power Automate** and click **Test Connection**. If it fails, reconnect using fresh **Client Credentials** and update the connection in Power Automate.
