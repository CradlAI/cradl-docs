### Step 1: Start with a template

The fastest way to get started with Cradl AI is by copying a ready-made **Agent template**. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select template" icon="1" iconType="regular" stepNumber={1}>
    After creating your account, pick a template that best matches your use case. Every setting is fully customizable, so you can fine-tune your Agent to handle your specific document type and workflow. If none of the templates resembles your use case, you can always build an Agent from scratch using the **Custom** option.

      src="/images/select-template.webp"
      alt="select template"
      height="300"
      className="rounded-lg"
      title="select template"
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add integrations">
    Next step in the onboarding, you’ll also define **how you plan to integrate** your Agent into your workflow (e.g., export to a spreadsheet, database, or third-party app). This won’t set up the actual integration yet, but it helps configure your Agent with the right intent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import a test document">
    Once your Agent is created, you’ll be taken to the **Runs view** - the central place where all processed documents are listed.

    If you selected a template, we’ll automatically include a **sample document** flagged for review, so you can immediately test your Agent. You can also **manually upload documents** at any time by clicking **Import** in the top-right corner, a great way to test before setting up automatic imports.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review predictions">
    To review results, click on a document in the Runs table or use the _Review_ button to open the review interface. Here, you can check the AI’s predictions, make any needed corrections, and export your data by clicking **Confirm** when you’re ready.

    To review results, click on any document in the **Runs table** or use the **Review** button to open the review interface.

    Here, you can:

    - **Check the AI’s predictions** for each field
    - **Make corrections** as needed - your Agent learns from every edit
    - **Export your data** by clicking **Confirm** when you're ready. 

      <Note>
        **Note:** Data won't be exported automatically until you've set up an export integration. 
      </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### **Step 2: Edit your AI model**

To control what your AI model extracts, head to the **Workflows** section in the navigation panel.

1. Click on the **Extract with AI** node.
2. In the panel on the right, you can:
   - **Add new fields** for the AI to extract
   - **Define validation rules** to ensure data accuracy
   - **Add formatters** to make sure the output is consistent

Customize your model to match the structure and requirements of your specific documents.

### **Step 3: Set up integrations**

To connect your AI Agent to the rest of your workflow, you’ll need to configure integrations.

In the **Workflows** section, you can:

- **Add triggers** to automatically process new documents
- **Set up export destinations** (e.g., databases, spreadsheets, or external tools)

This ensures your extracted data flows seamlessly into the systems where it’s needed.
