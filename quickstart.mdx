### Step 1: Start with a template

The fastest way to get up and running is to copy a template.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select template" icon="1" iconType="regular" stepNumber={1}>
    After creating your account, simply choose the agent template that’s closest to your use case. Every setting is fully customizable, so you can adapt your agent to match your specific document type and workflow. If none of the templates fit your needs, you can always start with the **Custom** option.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add integrations">
    Next step in the onboarding, you’ll also define **how you plan to integrate** your agent into your workflow. Your agent will be set up with this intent in mind, but you’ll configure the actual integrations later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import a test document">
    Once your agent is created, you’ll be directed to the **Runs** view. This is where you’ll see all documents processed by your AI agent. If you selected a template, we’ll add a **sample document** that’s flagged for human review, so you can test your agent right away. Before setting up automatic imports, you can also manually import documents by clicking **Import** in the top right corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review predictions">
    To review results, click on a document in the Runs table or use the _Review_ button to open the review interface. Here, you can check the AI’s predictions, make any needed corrections, and export your data by clicking **Confirm** when you’re ready.
  </Step>
</Steps>
